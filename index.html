Mount Everest is the world's tallest mountain. It straddles the border of China and Nepal and can be visited from either side.At an elevation of 8,848.13 meters, Mount Everest, or Mount Qomolangma is the main peak of the Himalayas. This world’s No. 1 peak rises high on the border of China and Nepal. It’s northern slope lies in the Tingri County of Tibet. Commanding reverence from fellow giant peaks nearby, Mount Everest is shaped just like a majestic pyramid propping up the sky for the Earth. Surrounding Mt. Everest, 4 (Mt. Makalu, Mt. Lhotse, Mt. Cho Oyu and Mt. Shishapangma) of the world’s 14 peaks above 8,000 meters stand guard within a sphere of 200 square kilometers. They are escorted by another 38 peaks above 7,000 meters above sea level. Together they form one of the world’s most grandiose landscapes.</p>
